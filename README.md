# Portfolio-Website
Personal Portfolio detailing my past job experiences as well as projects that I have been a part of.

## Introduction

This repository contains code for my personal website. This project focuses more on basic HTML, JS, and CSS to create simple/clean UIs and screens whether on a Desktop or Mobile Device.

## Project Detail

Within this project, I wanted to review some aspects of HTML and JS by creating a simple portfolio detailing past accomplishments and potential work that I will be contributing to.
